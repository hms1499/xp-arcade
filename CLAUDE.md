## 1. Project Overview

**XP Arcade** — a Windows-95-themed, multi-game arcade platform with Stacks
blockchain integration. Players play Snake, Tetris, Pac-Man, and XP Bricks
(Breakout); each game mints Score NFTs, maintains an on-chain top-10, and
accumulates mint fees into a per-season prize pool. All games share one on-chain
registry contract, `xp-arcade-v4`, keyed by `game-id`.

## 2. Tech Stack

- **Contract:** Clarity 3 (pinned), Clarinet 3.14, `@stacks/clarinet-sdk` ^3.9,
  Vitest 3. Deployed mainnet:
  `SP2CMK69QNY60HBG8BJ4X5TD7XX2ZT4XB62V13SV.xp-arcade-v4`.
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript 5, `98.css`,
  Tailwind v4, Zustand 5.
- **Stacks SDK:** `@stacks/connect` ^8.2, `@stacks/transactions` ^7.4,
  `@stacks/network` ^7.3.
- **Deploy:** Vercel (frontend), Stacks mainnet (contract — already deployed).

Workspaces: `contract/` (Clarinet project) · `frontend/` (Next.js app) ·
`docs/` (specs) · `HANDOFF.md` (user-facing to-do list).

## 3. Dev Commands

```bash
# contract/
cd contract
npm test                       # all Clarinet/Vitest tests
clarinet check                 # syntax-check the .clar contracts
clarinet console               # REPL against simnet

# frontend/
cd frontend
npm run dev                    # Next dev server on :3000 (Turbopack)
npm run build                  # production build
npm test                       # Vitest
npx tsc --noEmit               # full type-check
npm run lint
```

Required Vercel env vars are listed in
[environment-quirks.md](.claude/docs/environment-quirks.md) and
`frontend/.env.example`.

## 4. Core Logic Summary

Mint fees are held **in the contract** (`as-contract`) and accumulate into a
per-game, per-season **prize pool**. After the owner closes a season
(`end-season`), top-10 players claim **trustlessly on-chain** via `claim-prize`.
Split bands: **positions 1–3 = 20% each; positions 4–10 = 4/70 (~5.71%) each**.
**Tied scores split the combined value of the positions they occupy equally**
(order-independent — the v4 fix). Amounts are floored to integer uStx; total
paid is capped to the pool. Claims are open for ~30 days (`CLAIM-WINDOW = u4320`
burn blocks). After the window closes, anyone can call `finalize-season` to roll
unclaimed shares + integer-division dust into the next season's pool (nothing
locked forever). The split is authoritative **on-chain**; `lib/payout-schedule.ts`
mirrors the band schedule for display + post-conditions. Players claim from the
High Scores window (`claimPrizeV3`); Season Admin is read-only. Full detail:
[prize-logic.md](.claude/docs/prize-logic.md).

## 5. Key Constraints

Never change/assume these without explicit instruction (full list in
[architecture-decisions.md](.claude/docs/architecture-decisions.md)):

- **Path must not contain spaces** — Vitest breaks on `%20`. Keep
  `Desktop/xp-snake/`.
- **Clarity version is 3**, not 4 (`as-contract` breaks under Clarity 4 here).
  `.clar` files are **ASCII only**.
- **Score is client-trusted** (no on-chain anti-cheat); `MAX-SCORE u9999` caps
  abuse. Don't invent anti-cheat scope.
- **Top-10 is unsorted on-chain**; the frontend sorts on read.
- **Prize pool is held in-contract; claims are trustless on-chain** —
  `claim-prize` transfers STX via `as-contract`; players claim from High Scores.
  Do not revert to v2's owner-initiated manual payouts.
- **Owner detection is the on-chain `get-contract-owner`** (`lib/owner.ts`), not
  an address heuristic; async, so "loading" = not-owner.
- **Wallet post-conditions are required** for any token-moving write.
- **Don't add public contract functions without tests** (keep synced with spec
  §7). Don't merge the focused Zustand stores into one.
- **Git:** conventional prefixes, small green commits, no `Co-Authored-By`,
  stage explicit files, commit only when asked. See
  [git-workflow.md](.claude/docs/git-workflow.md).
- **Run the actual build/test and read its output before claiming done.**
